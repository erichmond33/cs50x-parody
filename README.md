-- THIS IS THE RIGHT SUBMISSION, THE OTHER ONE IS MISSING A FILE ---

Hello, I am Eli Richmond. I had such an amazing experience with CS50x 2020 that I decided to freeze it in time with my final project. The goal for this project was to recreate all of the problem sets that I did for this course in an easy intuitive form, so anyone can go back and relive the problem sets without delving into each raw C/Python program. Within this website you can find many little jokes and references from the course that I hope you might enjoy. Thank you CS50x team for my truly spectacular learning experience.# cs50x-remix
