This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students' choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.">

  <!-- Movies --->

  <h2><a id="movies" href="/movies">Movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<---- My Project!</h2>

  <p>Provided to you is a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies.db</code>, a SQLite database that stores data from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a> about movies, the people who directed and starred in them, and their ratings.</p>

  <p>Notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies</code> table has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> column that uniquely identifies each movie, as well as columns for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> of a movie and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year</code> in which the movie was released. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">people</code> table also has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> column, and also has columns for each person’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth</code> year.</p>

  <p>Movie ratings, meanwhile, are stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ratings</code> table. The first column in the table is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movie_id</code>: a foreign key that references the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies</code> table. The rest of the row contains data about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code> for each movie and the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">votes</code> the movie has received on IMDb.</p>

  <p>Finally, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stars</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">directors</code> tables match people to the movies in which they acted or directed. (Only <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">principal</a> stars and directors are included.) Each table has just two columns: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movie_id</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person_id</code>, which reference a specific movie and person, respectively.</p>

  <p>The challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables.</p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.</p>



     <!-- Houses --->

    <h2><a id="houses" href="/houses">Houses</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<---- My Project!</h2>

    <p>Hogwarts is in need of a student database. For years, the professors have been maintaing a CSV file containing all of the students’ names and houses and years. But that file didn’t make it particularly easy to get access to certain data, such as a roster of all the Ravenclaw students, or an alphabetical listing of the students enrolled at the school.</p>

    <p>The challenge ahead of you is to import all of the school’s data into a SQLite database, and write a Python program to query that database to get house rosters for each of the houses of Hogwarts.</p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>Implement a program to import student data into a database, and then produce class rosters.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python import.py characters.csv
    $ python roster.py Gryffindor

    Lavender Brown, born 1979
    Colin Creevey, born 1981
    Seamus Finnigan, born 1979
    Hermione Jean Granger, born 1979
    Neville Longbottom, born 1980
    Parvati Patil, born 1979
    Harry James Potter, born 1980
    Dean Thomas, born 1980
    Romilda Vane, born 1981
    Ginevra Molly Weasley, born 1981
    Ronald Bilius Weasley, born 1980
    </code></pre></div></div>
