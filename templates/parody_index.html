This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students' choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.">

      <p>Demanding, but hardly doable. Social, but still really hard. A focused topic, and a firehose of information. CS50 is the quintessential Harvard course.</p>

    <p>Hello, I am Eli Richmond. I had such an amazing experience with CS50x 2020 that I decided to freeze it in time with my final project. The goal for this project was to recreate all of the problem sets that I did for this course in an easy intuitive form, so anyone can go back and relive the problem sets without delving into each raw C/Python program. Within this website you can find many little jokes and references from the course that I hope you might enjoy. Thank you CS50x team for my truly spectacular learning experience.</p>

    <p class="small text-muted">** Make sure you have some solid headphones to watch this remix. You will thank me later. **</p>
