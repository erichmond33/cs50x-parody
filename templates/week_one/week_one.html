This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students' choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.">

<!-- Hello --->

  <h2><a id="hello" href="/hello">Hello</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<---- My Project!</h2>

  <p>Suffice it to say, no matter how you compile or execute this program, it only ever prints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello, world</code>. Let’s personalize it a bit, just as we did in class.</p>

  <p>Modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello, so-and-so</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so-and-so</code> is their actual name.</p>


<!-- Mario -->

  <h2><a id="mario" href="/mario">Mario</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<---- My Project!</h2>

  <p>Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over adjacent pyramids of blocks, per the below.</p>

  <p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sg2eAZ9tMTU/hqdefault.jpg" alt="screenshot of Mario jumping over adjacent pyramids"></p>

  <p>Let’s recreate those pyramids in C, albeit in text, using hashes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramids themselves are also be taller than they are wide.</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <p>Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code> when prompted:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./mario
  Height: 4
     #  #
    ##  ##
   ###  ###
  ####  ####
  </code></pre></div></div>


<!-- Credit --->

  <h2><a id="credit" href="/credit">Credit</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<---- My Project!</h2>

  <p>A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that’s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers.  And those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)</p>

  <p>Actually, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won’t concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. But credit card numbers also have a “checksum” built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.</p>

  <h3>Implementation</h3>

  <p>In a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">credit.c</code> in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/pset1/credit/</code> directory, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf</code>) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AMEX\n</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTERCARD\n</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VISA\n</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INVALID\n</code>, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./credit
  Number: 4003600000000014
  VISA
  </code></pre></div></div>

                </main>

            </div>

        </div>
